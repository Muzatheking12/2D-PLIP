# 2D PLIP
<p>Generate 2D Protein-Ligand Interaction with PLIP output (report.txt and complex.pdb given to PLIP as input)</p>
<Img src=".\2DPLIP.png" >

# Interactions Reported
<li>H-Bond - Solid Grey</li>
<li>Hydrophobic Interactions - Dashed Grey</li>
<li>Pi-Pi Stacking - Dashed Green</li>
<li>Halogen Bond - Solid Cyan</li>
<li>Pi-Cation - Dashed Orange</li>
<li>Salt Bridges -  Dotted Yellow</li>

# Instructions to NOTE:

<li> At First, Use PLIP to generate report.txt (<b>CLI command: plip -f complex.pdb -pty</b> </li>
<li> Use 2D PLIP function , Two_Dimensional_Interactions giving arguements (residuename of the atom your looking to see interactions eg: UNL, complex.pdb path (complex you have given as input to PLIP), report.txt path which is a output file generated by PLIP and give output directory to save your PNG</li>
<li>Please note that sometimes interactions might interchange due lig_idx being misplaced in report.txt</li>

# How it Works:

<p> It works by taking the lig_idx mentoned in the report.txt which matches with PDB atom serial number . Now this is mapped with RDKit mol object (atom_idx) got with the extraction of PDB file. The Interactions are plotted accordingly with corresponding Amino acid labels which are mapped with the lig_idx in the first place. Amino acid labels are not represntative of their 3D coordinates </p>

# Limitations

<li> Lig_idx misplaced</li>
<li> Double-Triple Bond not displaced would require assign bond orders by RDkit</li>
<p> Pleas contribute to make it more better</p>

# Dependency
Rdkit, Matplotlib, Biopython , Numpy, and PIL
